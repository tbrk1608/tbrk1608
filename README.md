### Hi there, I'm Vamsy Tammineedi (tbrk1608) ðŸ‘‹

With three years of experience as a Data Engineer, I possess a strong command of Python, R, SQL, Big Data, and Machine Learning tools. My enthusiasm lies in applying my data engineering expertise to address complex challenges and foster innovation in the field of data science and engineering.

I earned my Master's degree in Business Analytics from the University of Illinois at Chicago. During my tenure as a Data Science Engineer (R/D) Intern at CCC Intelligent Solutions, I engaged in AI model experiments, machine learning model deployment, and building data pipelines.

Before relocating to the US for my Master's, I spent two years as a Project Engineer at Wipro in India, and as a Junior Data Scientist at Datafoundry in Bangalore, India. In these roles, I honed my skills in automating manual processes and training NLP-based machine learning models.
