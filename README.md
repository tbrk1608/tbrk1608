ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vamsy Tammineedi,

Exploring data to uncover patterns and generating insights inspires me. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Business Analytics at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and looking for summer internships in 2022. 


I worked as a Project Engineer at Wipro Ltd in Hyderabad, India for 1.9 yrs where I developed an ML model for AI FAQ bot using NLP techniques and also automated several manual processes. 


Prior to this, I worked as a Junior Data Scientist in Datafoundry at Bengaluru, India where I built an automated clinical drug's label document review tool and NLP module for identification of contradiction statements in medical guidelines.
